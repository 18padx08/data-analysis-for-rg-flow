# Data analysis for master thesis "Machine Learning Renormalization Group Flow"
## Abstract
Machine learning has entered the field of physics, and is now being analyzed thoroughly. In this thesis a new application of a modified Restricted Boltzmann machine is introduced, in order to solve the renormalization group flow for the Ising Model and the ![phi^4](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\phi^4) model.
